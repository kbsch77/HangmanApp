# Overview

I wanted to create my first app through this software. 
This program is a simple hangman game that reveals the first two letters of the word, and gives you six tries to think of the rest of the word to win. 
I hoped to be able to demonstrate an understanding of Kotlin, Android Studio, and GitHub.
